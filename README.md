# Password_Generator

## Description
This project utilized JavaScript for end-users to generate a random password. End-users are prompted for password characteristics after pressing the 'Generate Password' button. Passwords that were generated could have lower-case and upper-case letters, integers, and special characters. It also required for the end-users to enter information that falls within these requirements as well. This project was built using both JavaScript in conjunction with web APIs.
